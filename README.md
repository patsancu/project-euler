## Project Euler Solutions

These are solutions that I created for various Project Euler (http://projecteuler.net) problems.

The JavaScript, Python, and Scheme files should calculate and print the answer automatically.  The Haskell files will need to be run in an ghci or a similar interactive interpreter to view the variable `answer`.  The JavaScript files can be run with [rhino](https://www.mozilla.org/rhino/).
